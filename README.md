# Wely

This project is about creating an Internet of Things based weighting lysimeter. The purpose is to take care of plants either manually or through an automation system. It is also designed to gather data for scientific use, sending data to the MATLAB-integrated service ThingSpeak.

The type of device, a WEighting LYsimeter has been concatenated to give the project and device name Wely. This tool is being designed for organic  farmers producing Cannabis sativa but one of the advantages of lysimetry is that it is widely applicable to other plants and farming systems. The main use in mind is to track the water content of a potted plant.

This repository was created from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Jan. 9, 2019. Previous code development has been done with the Particle IDE (in C++). The device is being built around a Particle Photon. The Particle IDE was sufficient to show proof of concept and get a number of devices operating. Data logs for devices which publish publicly can be viewed on ThingSpeak.com by looking for public channels with the tag "wely".

Development started in the summer of 2018 by James Douglas in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Now that the basic product has been demonstrated, this code repository has been created to facilitate more advanced development involving multiple authors and additional features.

The stable version of the code that has been function for 6 devices for the past few weeks is entitled Wely6. It is the first version of code on this repository.
